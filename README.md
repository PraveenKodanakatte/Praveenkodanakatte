👨‍💻 Hi there! I'm Praveen, a passionate software developer who loves solving problems with code.

🚀 I specialize in full-stack development, building scalable applications that are as intuitive as they are powerful. Whether it’s designing pixel-perfect frontends or architecting robust backends, I’m always looking for new challenges to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

🔧 Technologies I work with:

Languages: Java, Springboot, Hibernate, Junit, JavaScript.
Frameworks & Libraries: ReactJs
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, AWS
🌍 I believe in the power of open-source, and contribute to projects that make the web more accessible, sustainable, and innovative.

🛠️ On the side: I love experimenting with AI & machine learning, building small tools to automate life, and exploring new languages and frameworks.

🔗 Let's connect! I'm always open to collaborations, side projects, or just chatting about new tech trends.
